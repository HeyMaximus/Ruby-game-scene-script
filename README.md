# Ruby-game-scene-script
A set of three scenes events I scripted in RPG Maker VX ACE using Ruby Game Scripting System 2 with 90's Japanese role playing game assets. 

Background:
Summoner's Cafe is a pop-up cafe concieved in 2013 as an amalgimation of Japanese Maid Cafes and cosplay.  As a non-profit, fan-run organization, Summoner's Cafe recruit and specially train cosplay volunteers every year to create memorable events at anime & gaming conventions.
